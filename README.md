# Al Qadisiyah Dealership Intelligence Platform

Mobile-first, offline-first field survey tool for mapping and qualifying independent car
dealerships in the Al Qadisiyah market (East Riyadh) for embedded auto-financing.

**Status: Phase 1 (map + survey + offline sync + dashboard) and Phase 2 (research agent) are
built.** Phase 3 (operational layer, multi-user) is not started.

## What's here

- **Map** (`/`) — colour-coded pins by visit status, satellite/street toggle, near-me sort,
  walking-route planner, quick "add dealership" capture.
- **Survey** (`/survey/[id]`) — 9-step mobile form covering identity, business identity,
  people, commercial terms, financing pain, customers, and a mandatory data-quality gate.
  Autosaves every field to IndexedDB; works fully offline.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — coverage, field completeness, an **Observed-only** toggle on
  every aggregate, pilot pipeline, top leads, and CSV/Excel export.
- **Settings** (`/settings`) — dark mode, CSV/Excel import (bring in your own survey sheet),
  OpenStreetMap-based discovery of nearby real dealerships not yet on the roster, research
  tasks and cost control, reset.
- **Research agent** (Phase 2) — see below.

## Research agent (Phase 2)

Looks up *public* facts about a dealership (CR number, listed phone, brands, social handles,
advertised financing, reviews) with Claude + web search in English and Arabic. It never
estimates private figures like monthly sales or financing share — those stay field-collected.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| Settings → Research tasks | Write tasks in plain language (or start from a template). Pick what field it writes to, sources, and a schedule: on-demand, daily or weekly. Change schedule/scope on a saved task inline. |
| Survey → 🔍 Research | Run any task for this dealership. Each finding shows value, confidence, source link, cost. **Accept** writes it into the record and adds a provenance line to the notes; replacing an existing value asks first. **Reject** discards it. |
| Settings → Research cost control | Daily run cap, spend today / last 30 days, batch runner (task × scope, cost estimate from your real average, confirm, stop). |
| Dashboard → Research alerts | Values that changed since the last successful lookup (Review / Dismiss) and suspected duplicates (Merge / Not a duplicate). |
| Dashboard → Export Excel | Adds an **Agent findings** sheet, separate from field-collected columns. |

**Trust rules built in**

- Findings sit in their own store and never overwrite field data unless you accept them.
- A finding whose source URL is not one of the pages the search actually returned is
  downgraded to *low* confidence and labelled "verify before accepting". Non-http(s) links are dropped.
- A lookup that simply finds nothing is not treated as a "change".

**Scheduling.** There is no backend, so daily/weekly tasks run *while the app is open and
online* (checked shortly after opening, then every 30 minutes). Each task × dealership pair is
re-checked once per interval, never-checked first. Scheduled runs use at most 80% of the daily
cap, so manual runs always have room; a 300-dealership roster is worked through over several
days. Pause it in Settings.

**Duplicates.** Flags when every distinctive word of one English name appears in the other (whole words, so
"Hala" never matches inside "Shalal", and a shared place name like "Riyadh" alone is not enough)
*or* on an exact Arabic-name match after
normalising spelling (catches transliteration variants like "Idris Car" / "Idrees Car").
Proximity alone never flags — showrooms here sit metres apart. Re-scans don't re-add pairs you
dismissed. **Merge** keeps the record you choose: its values win, the other fills only empty
fields, explicit statuses (competitor / refused / closed) are never downgraded, and photos,
notes, findings and run history move across before the other record is deleted.

### Deploying research

Set two environment variables on the deployment:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key |
| `RESEARCH_ACCESS_TOKEN` | A long random code (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24`). Enter the same code in Settings → Research access code on each device. |

Research stays disabled until both are set — without the access code, anyone who found the
app's URL could spend your API credit. The in-app daily cap is per device, so also set a
monthly spend limit on the API key's workspace in the Anthropic Console as the hard ceiling.

Cost per run is billed tokens plus web searches ($10 per 1,000); the app logs the real cost of
every run. The route allows up to 5 searches per run and `maxDuration = 60` seconds; if runs
time out and your hosting plan allows longer functions, raise `maxDuration` in
`src/app/api/research/run/route.ts`.

## The core data rule

Every business figure (inventory, price, monthly sold, monthly financed, financing losses) is
stored as `{ value, basis }` where `basis` is `observed` or `self_reported`. Dashboard
aggregates default to **Observed-only** and never silently blend the two. This mirrors the
field-survey philosophy: what you can count with your own eyes vs. what the dealer told you.

## Seed data provenance

The starting roster (`src/lib/seed.ts`) combines two real sources — no dealership names or
figures are invented:

1. The original 38-dealership mapping-data list for the district.
2. A 43-record manually-surveyed master table. Four records matched an existing mapping-data
   entry by name and <20m GPS proximity and were merged in place; the other 39 are distinct
   dealerships (this market has many showrooms per block, so nearby ≠ duplicate) added as
   additional pins.

This gives ~75 real starting records. The Al Qadisiyah market has far more dealerships than
that — growing the roster further should come from continued field survey (use **Import** in
Settings to bring in updated sheets) or from **Discover more dealerships** in Settings, which
queries OpenStreetMap for real, sourced candidate pins near the market to go verify in person.
Nothing in this app fabricates a dealership.

## Architecture notes

- **Local-first, single device.** All data lives in IndexedDB on the device — the app is fully
  functional with zero network. There is no backend in Phase 1. An optional "cloud sync
  endpoint" can be set in Settings as a forward-compatible hook for a future backend; when
  unset the app is simply local-only (matches the plan's Phase 3 multi-user scope).
  Photos are stored as compressed blobs in IndexedDB, geotagged on capture.
- **Offline map tiles.** A service worker (`public/sw.js`) caches the app shell and any map
  tiles you've already viewed, so previously-loaded areas keep rendering with no signal.
  First load of a new area still needs connectivity.
- **Auth.** A lightweight local "who's surveying" gate (name only, no server) — enough to
  avoid leaving commercially sensitive data on an unlocked screen, not a real multi-user
  auth system. Multi-user support is explicitly Phase 3 in the plan.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint
```

Stack: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4, Leaflet/react-leaflet for the map,
`idb` for IndexedDB, ExcelJS for import/export.
